I'm starting my **AssDegInfoTech<sup>TM</sup>** in February. I find it hard to visualise what I know, where I've been, where I'm going next. So I finally got around to scribbling on these road maps and making a big todo list. A work in progress, forever, until I die.

## Roadmaps

Taken from @kamranahmedse's [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). Scribbled on by me.

I started a **Master of Information Technology** in March, 2020. I find it hard to visualise what I know, where I've been, where I'm going next. So I finally got around to scribbling on these road maps and making a big todo list. A work in progress, forever, until I die. 

## Work in progress

- [x] Node / Express
- [x] Docker / Docker Compose
- [x] Local Storage
- [x] Users, Database managment
- [ ] Processing and p5.js
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] JWT Auth login, etc.
- [ ] Networking 101

## Roadmaps

Taken from @kamranahmedse's [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). Scribbled on by me.

I started a **Master of Information Technology** in March, 2020. I find it hard to visualise what I know, where I've been, where I'm going next. So I finally got around to scribbling on these road maps and making a big todo list. A work in progress, forever, until I die!

Download your roadmaps from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh), fork this repo and forge ahead with me, if you dare.

## Work in progress
